# Problem statement

Sort elements of an array by their frequency. Given an array of N integers, that task is to sort the array using the **Sort** method so that the following requirements are met:

1. Array is sorted in increasing frequency.

2. Numbers with the same frequency are sorted in decreasing order.

3. Build in **Sort** method should be used only.

## Sample Input 1

{ 3, 6, 3, 7, 9, 102, 3, 6, 6, 6, 102 }

## Sample Output 1

{ 9, 7, 102, 102, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6 }

## Sample Input 2

{ 40, 15, 40, 7, 15, 6, 7, 7 }

## Sample Output 2

{ 6, 40, 40, 15, 15, 7, 7, 7 }

## Sample Input 3

{ 22, 53, 22, 6, -1, 999, 53, 8, 8, 8 }

## Sample Output 3

{ 999, 6, -1, 53, 53, 22, 22, 8, 8, 8 }

## Sample Input 4

{ 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 6, 7, 5 }

## Sample Output 4

{ 7, 6, 5, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2 }
